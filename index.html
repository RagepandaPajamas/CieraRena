          <h2>Why Homemade Masks?</h2>
        </a>
        <p>According to the
          <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">
            CDC Website</a> cloth face coverings are meant for when you are in a place where you cannot practice social distancing.
            Cloth masks are to help SLOW the spread of the virus.
            We aslo want to make sure that any medical grade masks are reserved for those who are most at risk.
            </p>
            <h4> About My Masks</h4>
<!-- add link to instructables site here -->
            <p>I am making my masks based off of <A href="">this</a> pattern. I made very little alterations including using cord instead of elastic when I had none.
              <br>
              Each mask has a nose wire to help the mask fit to your nose and a filter pocket.
              I recommend using coffee filters and disposing of them after each use to help protect you and others.
              Please do not try to use these masks on children under 2 years old.
              Avoid taking your kids with you to the grocery store if you can to reduce the number of people out in public areas.
            <h4>Cleaning</h4>
            <p>The CDC recommends using your washer to clean your mask. You should use normal deturgent and warm water as well as dry the masks.
              My masks are made of cotton so they may shrink a little when dryed.
              <br>Be sure to wash after every use!
              <h4>How long will it take?</h4>
              <p>Each mask takes me about 45 to an hour to make. My goal is to make at least 4 a day, sometimes 5.
                (I need my downtime) I make the masks by request and first come first serve.
                I also want to provide those who are working in deliveries, grocery stores, and other services that are in close contact with others.

          <h2>How Can I Pay?</h2></a>
          <p>Paying is not neccessary, however if I need to ship your masks that can get pretty pricey.
            <br>
            Cost of shipping the masks is around $10 within the U.S. If you'd like to find the exact cost you can use the USPS website to calculate the cost from zipcode 78741.
            <br>
            If you would like to contribute to the cost of the masks, they cost me about $5 each to make.
            <br>
            Even if you don't want to request any masks, donations are much appreciated to help pay for the cost of those who I am not asking for payment. I know a lot of delivery workers, people who aren't able to collect unemployment, and more that are in need and I want to help any way I can.</p>
